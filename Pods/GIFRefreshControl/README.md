## Installation

You have multiple choices here:
* Copy `GIFRefreshControl.swift` in your project.
* Adding it in your Podfile `pod 'GIFRefreshControl'`

## Usage
```swift
let URL = NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource("giphy", withExtension: "gif")
let data = NSData(contentsOfURL: URL!)

let refreshControl = GIFRefreshControl()
refreshControl.animatedImage = GIFAnimatedImage(data: data!)
refreshControl.contentMode = .ScaleAspectFill
refreshControl.addTarget(self, action: "refresh", forControlEvents: .ValueChanged)
tableView.addSubview(refreshControl)
```

### Memory consideration

Right now, the default implementation of `GIFAnimatedImage` is not optimized for memory. That's why you are able to use your custom implementation by using `AnimatedImage` (like [`FLAnimatedImage`](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage)). `AnimatedImage` is a protocol that describe what is needed to use it in the refresh control.
